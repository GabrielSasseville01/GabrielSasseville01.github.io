I’m Gabriel Sasseville, a PhD student at Mila Institute in Montreal, Canada. My research focuses on artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning for symbolic reasoning. I have a strong academic foundation in both computer science and physics, having completed my B.Sc. in Comp Sci/Physics and my Master's in Astrophysics. During my master's, I also worked as a research scientist in AI for Environment and Climate Change Canada, working on developing an LSTM-based hydrology forecasting model.

Driven by a passion for discovery and interdisciplinary research, I aim to contribute to the frontier of AI applications in science and societal challenges. I am mainly interested in leveraging large language models' reasoning capabilities for real-world scientific discovery. In addition to my research, I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects and sharing insights through publications and public engagement.

Current Research Project
======
My PhD research explores the intersection of symbolic regression, large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning for scientific discovery. I focus on developing LLM-based systems capable of reasoning about mathematical structures and generating interpretable analytical equations directly from data. By fine-tuning language models for symbolic reasoning and integrating reinforcement learning feedback loops, my work aims to build autonomous frameworks that can discover, verify, and refine scientific laws, bridging human-like reasoning with data-driven modeling.

Research Interests
======
- **Application-Driven Machine Learning**: Focusing on application-driven AI research to tackle complex challenges in various fields.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring applications of reinforcement learning in scientific problem-solving and discovery.
