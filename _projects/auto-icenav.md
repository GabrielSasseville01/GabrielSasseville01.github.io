This project demonstrates **Diffusion Model Predictive Control (DMPC)** for safe and efficient navigation in stochastic ice environments. Our approach leverages real-world data to create an accurate simulation environment for autonomous ship navigation in ice-covered waters.

## Key Features

- **Real-World Data Integration**: Utilizes real satellite imagery data to generate ice maps, providing realistic representations of ice floe distributions in the Arctic region
- **Ice Ridge Detection**: Employs satellite imagery to detect ice ridges and generate real ice ridge density maps, enabling precise modeling of ice structure and navigation hazards
- **Dynamic Environment Modeling**: Incorporates real ocean current data to accurately model the dynamic marine environment
- **Comprehensive Simulation**: Together, these real-world data sources create a comprehensive and realistic testing environment for autonomous navigation algorithms
